    "about": "I am a junior Computer Science student as St. Mary's University. I have been passionate about programming since I was first introduced to it in middle school through various robotics camps and my participation in the PREP program. I am focusing on learning game development through out my univeristy studies but welcome all opportunities to learn new skills and technologies. It is important to me to stay involved in my community. I am currently the team manager for the St. Mary's Univeristy Esports Rocket League team and Vice President of our local computer  science club Infinite Loops. Through these positions I aim to connect with other students and help cultivate an interest in tech within all curious minds.",
